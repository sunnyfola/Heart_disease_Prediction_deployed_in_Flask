# Heart_disease_Prediction_deployed_in_Flask
This model was initially built with Naive_Bayes algorithm ,however before deployment,we discovered alot of lapses during testing.
It is now built with RandomForest Classifier. with accuracy of 0.92 at training and 0.87 validation.
A great performing model indeed
